Step 1: Preparing the Dataset; can you write me a r code to clean the data 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s an R script to clean and prepare your dataset for analysis, focusing on key issues like missing values, filtering out irrelevant entries, and standardizing supplier names. This assumes your dataset is in a CSV file named toronto_contracts.csv.

R Script for Cleaning the Dataset
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)       # For data manipulation
library(tidyr)       # For handling missing data
library(stringr)     # For string operations
library(readr)       # For reading CSV files

# Step 1: Load the dataset
file_path <- "toronto_contracts.csv"  # Adjust the file name/path as needed
contracts <- read_csv(file_path)

# Step 2: Inspect the dataset
glimpse(contracts)  # Get an overview of the dataset
summary(contracts)  # Summary of numeric fields
head(contracts)     # View the first few rows

# Step 3: Handle missing values
# Drop rows where critical fields are missing
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Awarded.Amount) & Awarded.Amount > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Awarded.Amount
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))                     # Remove rows with missing supplier names

# Step 4: Standardize supplier names
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Successful.Supplier = str_to_title(Successful.Supplier))  # Standardize supplier names to Title Case

# Step 5: Remove duplicates
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  distinct()  # Remove exact duplicate rows

# Step 6: Filter relevant fields (optional)
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  select(
    Document.Number,
    RFx.Type,
    High.Level.Category,
    Successful.Supplier,
    Awarded.Amount,
    Award.Date,
    Division
  )

# Step 7: Check for potential small business indicators (optional)
# For instance, you might classify small businesses based on Awarded.Amount threshold
small_business_threshold <- 100000  # Example: Define small business threshold
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Is.Small.Business = ifelse(Awarded.Amount <= small_business_threshold, TRUE, FALSE))

# Step 8: Save the cleaned data to a new CSV
write_csv(contracts_cleaned, "toronto_contracts_cleaned.csv")

# Step 9: Summary of cleaned data
summary(contracts_cleaned)
Explanation of Steps
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset for analysis.
Inspect: Use glimpse() and summary() to understand the structure of your data.
Handle Missing Values: Remove rows where critical fields like Awarded.Amount or Successful.Supplier are missing.
Standardize Supplier Names: Use str_to_title() to make supplier names consistent.
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate rows to avoid double-counting.
Filter Relevant Fields: Retain only the fields necessary for your analysis.
Classify Small Businesses (Optional): Add a column to flag contracts likely awarded to small businesses.
Save Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
Let me know if you need help customizing this script further or analyzing the cleaned data!

The error indicates that the column name Awarded.Amount does not match the actual column name in your dataset. This could be due to differences in capitalization, spelling, or punctuation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

Steps to Fix
Inspect the Column Names: Check the actual column names in your dataset using the following code:

r
Copy code
colnames(contracts)
Locate the Correct Column Name: Identify the column name corresponding to Awarded.Amount (it might be something like Awarded_Amount or Award Amount).

Replace Awarded.Amount with the Correct Name: Update the script to use the correct column name.

Updated Code
Assuming the correct column name is Award.Value (based on the dataset description), replace Awarded.Amount with Award.Value:

r
Copy code
# Step 3: Handle missing values
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Award.Value) & Award.Value > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Award.Value
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))               # Remove rows with missing supplier names
Debugging Tips
If you're unsure about the column names:

Use names(contracts) or colnames(contracts) to inspect them.
Check for typos, spaces, or special characters.
Full Inspection Code Example
r
Copy code
# Check the column names
colnames(contracts)

# Check a few rows to verify
head(contracts)
Let me know the column names if you're still facing issues, and I can adjust the code accordingly!

To simulate a dataset similar to the one you've shown, you can generate random data based on the patterns and structure of the columns in your original raw_data dataset.

Below is an R code that simulates a new dataset based on your cleaned data (raw_data), generating random values for the columns like Document_Number, RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, Division, and Small_Business.

This code will use the structure of the columns in your original dataset to simulate similar observations:

R Code to Simulate Data
r
Copy code
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility

# Example data for simulation
document_numbers <- unique(raw_data$Document_Number)  # Use unique document numbers from your dataset
rfx_types <- c("RFQ", "RFP", "RFSQ")  # Common RFx Types
high_level_categories <- unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category)  # Use categories from original data
suppliers <- unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier)  # List of suppliers
divisions <- unique(raw_data$Division)  # Divisions from the original data
small_business_options <- c(TRUE, FALSE)  # Small Business status

# Simulating Awarded Amounts (random values within a specified range)
award_amount_range <- c(500000, 50000000)  # Example range for Awarded Amount (e.g., between 500k and 50M)

# Randomly simulate Award Dates (e.g., within the last 2 years)
award_dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2022-01-01"), to = Sys.Date(), by = "day")

# Simulate new data
n_simulations <- 100  # Number of observations to simulate

simulated_data <- data.frame(
  Document_Number = sample(document_numbers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  RFx_Type = sample(rfx_types, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  High_Level_Category = sample(high_level_categories, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Successful_Supplier = sample(suppliers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Awarded_Amount = runif(n_simulations, min = award_amount_range[1], max = award_amount_range[2]),
  Award_Date = sample(award_dates, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Division = sample(divisions, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Small_Business = sample(small_business_options, n_simulations, replace = TRUE)
)


can you write me some code to test this simulated data.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! To test your simulated data, you can write some code to perform a few common data validation checks. These tests can help verify that the simulated data is generated correctly and adheres to the expected structure and constraints.

Here are some common tests and checks you can perform on the simulated data:

Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset.
Check for expected distributions in certain columns (e.g., random sampling of categories).
Check the range of numeric columns, like Awarded_Amount.
Check the type and structure of each column (e.g., ensuring that dates are in the correct format).
Check for duplicates in important columns like Document_Number.
Example Testing Code:
r
Copy code
# Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(simulated_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check the range of Awarded_Amount (should be between the specified range)
cat("\nRange of Awarded_Amount:\n")
cat("Min:", min(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if the 'Awarded_Amount' is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000)
award_range_check <- all(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount >= 500000 & simulated_data$Awarded_Amount <= 50000000)
cat("\nAwarded_Amount is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000):", award_range_check, "\n")

# Check the distribution of 'RFx_Type' values
cat("\nDistribution of RFx_Type:\n")
print(table(simulated_data$RFx_Type))

# Check the distribution of 'Small_Business' values
cat("\nDistribution of Small_Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(table(simulated_data$Small_Business))

# Check if 'Award_Date' is of Date type and within a reasonable range (last two years)
cat("\nCheck 'Award_Date' type and range:\n")
cat("Is Award_Date of Date type? ", is.Date(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Earliest Award Date:", min(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Latest Award Date:", max(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")

# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number'
duplicates <- any(duplicated(simulated_data$Document_Number))
cat("\nAre there duplicates in Document_Number?", duplicates, "\n")

# Check for expected number of unique values in key categorical columns
cat("\nNumber of unique 'RFx_Type' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$RFx_Type)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'High_Level_Category' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$High_Level_Category)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Division' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Division)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Successful_Supplier' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Successful_Supplier)), "\n")


You said: 
can you write me some test for the cleand data. 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a set of tests you can perform on your cleaned data (raw_data after the cleaning steps). These tests will check various aspects such as the structure of the data, the validity of specific columns, and whether the cleaning steps have been applied correctly.

Assumptions for Tests:
The dataset has been cleaned (empty rows removed, column names adjusted).
Columns like Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, and Successful_Supplier are correctly formatted.
The column names have been renamed (e.g., "RFx (Solicitation) Type" to "RFx_Type").
Tests for the Cleaned Data:
1. Check for Missing Values
Ensure that there are no missing values in critical columns (e.g., Document_Number, RFx_Type, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date).

r
Copy code
# Check for missing values in key columns
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(raw_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check if there are missing values in 'Awarded_Amount', 'RFx_Type', 'Award_Date', and 'Document_Number'
critical_columns <- c("Document_Number", "RFx_Type", "Awarded_Amount", "Award_Date")
missing_critical <- colSums(is.na(raw_data[, critical_columns]))
cat("\nMissing values in critical columns:\n")
print(missing_critical)
2. Check for Duplicates
Verify that there are no duplicate values in Document_Number and Unique_ID. These should likely be unique identifiers.

r
Copy code
# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number' and 'Unique_ID'
duplicates_document_number <- any(duplicated(raw_data$Document_Number))
duplicates_unique_id <- any(duplicated(raw_data$unique_id))

cat("\nAre there duplicates in 'Document_Number'?", duplicates_document_number, "\n")
cat("Are there duplicates in 'Unique_ID'?", duplicates_unique_id, "\n")
3. Check for Valid Range of Awarded_Amount
Ensure that Awarded_Amount has reasonable values (e.g., no negative or zero amounts).

r
Copy code
# Check the range of 'Awarded_Amount'
cat("\nRange of 'Awarded_Amount':\n")
cat("Min:", min(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if any values in 'Awarded_Amount' are zero or negative
invalid_award_amount <- any(raw_data$Awarded_Amount <= 0)
cat("\nAre there any zero or negative values in 'Awarded_Amount'?", invalid_award_amount, "\n")
4. Check Data Types
Make sure that the data types are correct for each column. For example, Award_Date should be a Date type, and Awarded_Amount should be numeric.

r
Copy code
# Check data types of important columns
cat("\nData Types of Important Columns:\n")
cat("Award_Date is Date type:", is.Date(as.Date(raw_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Awarded_Amount is numeric:", is.numeric(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("RFx_Type is character:", is.character(raw_data$RFx_Type), "\n")
cat("Successful_Supplier is character:", is.character(raw_data$Successful_Supplier), "\n")
cat("Division is character:", is.character(raw_data$Division), "\n")
5. Check Valid Date Range for Award_Date
Ensure that the Award_Date falls within a reasonable time range, e.g., it should not be in the future or too far in the past (e.g., before 2000).

r
Copy code
# Check if 'Award_Date' is within a valid range (e.g., between 2000 and the current date)
valid_award_date_range <- all(raw_data$Award_Date >= as.Date("2000-01-01") & raw_data$Award_Date <= Sys.Date())

cat("\nAre all 'Award_Date' values within the valid range?", valid_award_date_range, "\n")
6. Check for Consistent Categories
Check that the categories in RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, and Division are consistent and match the expected values.

r
Copy code
# Check the unique values for important categorical columns
cat("\nUnique Values in 'RFx_Type':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$RFx_Type))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'High_Level_Category':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Division':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Division))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Successful_Supplier':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier))
7. Check Proportions of Small Business
If Small_Business is a critical column, check the proportions of TRUE/FALSE values to ensure they are within reasonable expectations.

r
Copy code
# Check the proportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE)
small_business_proportion <- table(raw_data$Small_Business)
cat("\nProportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(small_business_proportion)
8. Check Document Number Uniqueness
Ensure that Document_Number is unique, assuming it should be a unique identifier.

r
Copy code
# Check for unique Document Numbers
unique_documents <- length(unique(raw_data$Document_Number))
total_documents <- nrow(raw_data)

cat("\nAre 'Document_Number' unique?", unique_documents == total_documents, "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Document_Number':", unique_documents, "\n")
cat("Total number of rows:", total_documents, "\n")


how to make the division, up down instead of side side: log(1−P(Small_Business=1)/P(Small_Business=1))= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{RFx\_Type} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{High\_Level\_Category} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Awarded\_Amount})

This uses the \frac{numerator}{denominator} command in LaTeX to represent the division vertically, making it appear as a fraction.

Explanation:
\log is used to denote the logarithm.
The \frac{} command makes the fraction, placing the numerator above the denominator.
The terms inside the parentheses represent the fraction you were trying to write, i.e., the ratio between 
1
−
P
(
Small_Business
=

)
1−P(Small_Business=1) and 
P
(

P(Small_Business=1).
This LaTeX code should give you the equation in a more readable, vertically arranged format for the division.

how how is it in that code 
ChatGPT said:
I see what you're asking now — you want to know how to incorporate the LaTeX code properly for the "up-and-down" division within your expression. Here's how the division (with terms stacked vertically) looks in the LaTeX code:

latex
Copy code
\log\left( \frac{1 - P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}{P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{RFx\_Type} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{High\_Level\_Category} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Awarded\_Amount}
Explanation:
\log represents the logarithmic function.
\frac{} is the LaTeX command to create fractions (the division). The first argument inside the brackets is the numerator (the part on top), and the second argument is the denominator (the part on the bottom).
The division you wanted to represent is between 
1
−
P
(
Small_Business
=
1
)
1−P(Small_Business=1) and 
P
(
Small_Business
=

P(Small_Business=1), so it is written as \frac{1 - P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}{P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}.

can you code me some Model Fit Diagnostics
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here are some common model fit diagnostics for logistic regression in R, along with code examples you can apply to your model:

1. Check Model Fit Using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
The AIC is a measure of model quality, where lower values indicate a better fit while penalizing for model complexity.

r
Copy code
# Display AIC for the logistic model
AIC(log_model)
How to Interpret:
Compare the AIC value with other models (e.g., models with fewer or additional predictors). A lower AIC indicates better performance.
2. Hosmer-Lemeshow Test
This test checks if the observed outcomes match the predicted probabilities. It’s particularly useful for logistic regression models.

Install the required package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("ResourceSelection")
library(ResourceSelection)

# Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
hl_test <- hoslem.test(log_model$y, fitted(log_model), g = 10)  # g is the number of groups
hl_test
How to Interpret:
The test returns a p-value.
A p-value > 0.05 indicates the model fits well (observed and predicted values align closely).
A p-value ≤ 0.05 suggests poor fit.
3. Pseudo R-Squared (McFadden's R²)
McFadden’s R² is a pseudo R² value used for logistic regression to indicate how much variance is explained by the model.

Install the pscl package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("pscl")
library(pscl)

# Pseudo R-squared values
pscl::pR2(log_model)
Output:
The McFadden value is most commonly used.
Values between 0.2–0.4 indicate a good model fit for logistic regression.
4. Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
Evaluate how well the model classifies outcomes (small vs. large business) by creating a confusion matrix.

r
Copy code
# Create predicted probabilities
predicted_probs <- predict(log_model, type = "response")

# Set a threshold to classify (e.g., 0.5)
predicted_classes <- ifelse(predicted_probs > 0.5, TRUE, FALSE)

# Create a confusion matrix
table(Predicted = predicted_classes, Actual = Contract_data$Small_Business)

# Calculate accuracy
mean(predicted_classes == Contract_data$Small_Business)
How to Interpret:
The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified observations. Higher is better, but be cautious if the classes are imbalanced.
5. ROC Curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate vs. false positive rate, and AUC summarizes the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

Install the pROC package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("pROC")
library(pROC)

# Generate ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(Contract_data$Small_Business, predicted_probs)

# Plot the ROC curve
plot(roc_curve, col = "blue", lwd = 2, main = "ROC Curve")

# Calculate AUC
auc(roc_curve)
How to Interpret:
AUC ranges from 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination).
A value above 0.7 indicates a good model, while values above 0.8 suggest strong performance.
6. Residual Deviance
Residual deviance compares the model’s deviance to the null model (a model with no predictors). Lower residual deviance indicates a better fit.

r
Copy code
# Null deviance (model with no predictors)
log_model$null.deviance

# Residual deviance (current model)
log_model$deviance
How to Interpret:
Subtract residual deviance from null deviance to check how much better your model is compared to the null model.
Use a chi-squared test to assess statistical significance:
r
Copy code
df <- log_model$df.null - log_model$df.residual
p_value <- pchisq(log_model$null.deviance - log_model$deviance, df, lower.tail = FALSE)
p_value
A p-value < 0.05 indicates the model significantly improves over the null model.
Summary
These diagnostics help assess various aspects of your logistic regression model:

AIC evaluates the overall fit and complexity.
Hosmer-Lemeshow Test checks the goodness of fit.
Pseudo R² provides variance explained.
Confusion Matrix and Accuracy assess classification performance.
ROC and AUC measure the model's discrimination power.
Residual Deviance compares the model to a baseline.
Run these tests and interpret the outputs to validate your model and its ability to answer the research question effectively.

To display the models and their AIC values side by side in a table, you can use the broom package to tidy up the information and knitr::kable to format it as a table. Here's the R code:

R
Copy code
# Fit the logistic regression models
log_model <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount, 
                 data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

log_model2 <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category, 
                  data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

log_model3 <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount + RFx_Type * Awarded_Amount, 
                  data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

# Extract model AIC values
model_comparison <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Model 1: Base Model", 
            "Model 2: Without Awarded_Amount", 
            "Model 3: Interaction Term"),
  AIC = c(AIC(log_model), 
          AIC(log_model2), 
          AIC(log_model3))
)

# Display the table
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

model_comparison %>%
  kable(
    caption = "AIC Comparison of Logistic Regression Models",
    col.names = c("Model Description", "AIC"),
    align = c("l", "c"),
    digits = 2
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
Explanation:
Model Fitting: The three models (log_model, log_model2, and log_model3) are fitted with different specifications.
AIC Extraction: AIC() extracts the AIC values of each model, which are stored in a data frame.
Table Creation: knitr::kable is used to create the table with appropriate formatting, and kableExtra adds styling for better visualization.
This will produce a styled table displaying the AIC values for each model, helping you compare model fits. Let me know if you need additional customization!

ChatGPT said:
To format the date range as "day to day" (e.g., "2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31"), you can use the paste() function in R to combine the Min_Date and Max_Date values into a single string in the desired format.

Here's how you can modify your code:

Modifying the Code to Format the Date Range:
After extracting the Min_Date and Max_Date, you will concatenate them using paste().
Format the dates as needed (e.g., using format() to ensure a consistent format like "YYYY-MM-DD").
Updated Code for Date Range:
r
Copy code
# Calculate Date Range and format it as "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"
date_range <- Contract_data %>%
  summarise(
    Min_Date = min(Award_Date, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Date = max(Award_Date, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Format the date range as "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"
formatted_date_range <- paste(
  format(date_range$Min_Date, "%Y-%m-%d"),  # Format Min_Date
  "to",
  format(date_range$Max_Date, "%Y-%m-%d")   # Format Max_Date
)

# 1. General Information Table (Summary Stats + Date Range + Small/Large Business Count)
general_info_table <- tibble(
  Metric = c(
    "Min Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Max Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Avg Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Award Date Range",  # Update label to "Award Date Range"
    "Small Business Count", 
    "Large Business Count"
  ),
  Value = c(
    min_total_awarded_amount, 
    max_total_awarded_amount, 
    avg_total_awarded_amount,
    formatted_date_range,   # Use the formatted date range
    Small,
    Big
  )
)

# Print General Information Table (Summary Stats + Date Range + Small/Large Business Count)

    align = 'l',
    col.names = c("Metric", "Value")  # Ensure column names match the number of columns
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50")
Explanation:
Formatting Dates:
format(date_range$Min_Date, "%Y-%m-%d"): This formats the Min_Date as YYYY-MM-DD.
paste() combines the formatted Min_Date with Max_Date to create a string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD".
Updated Metric Label:
I updated "Min Award Date" and "Max Award Date" to a single entry: "Award Date Range", as you want to display the date range in a single cell.
Example Output:
Assuming your Min_Date is 2020-01-01 and Max_Date is 2024-12-31, the table will show something like:

Metric	Value
Min Total Awarded Amount	1000
Max Total Awarded Amount	5000
Avg Total Awarded Amount	2500
Award Date Range	2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31
Small Business Count	200
Large Business Count	50
This way, the date range is formatted as you requested. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

To display the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test results in a table, you can extract the key elements from the hl_test object and format them into a data frame. Then, you can use knitr::kable to present the results. Here's the code:

R
Copy code
# Perform the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
library(ResourceSelection)
hl_test <- hoslem.test(log_model$y, fitted(log_model), g = 10)

# Extract test results into a data frame

Explanation:
hl_test Execution: This performs the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, testing the model's goodness-of-fit.
Result Extraction: The key metrics—chi-squared statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value—are extracted from the hl_test object and stored in a data frame.
Table Formatting: knitr::kable and kableExtra are used to present the results in a clear and visually appealing table.
The resulting table will include the chi-squared value, degrees of freedom, and p-value, providing insights into the goodness of fit for the logistic regression model.

To adjust the spacing between columns in your table so that the columns for "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" are not too far apart, you can tweak the column widths and alignment further. Here's how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
# Prepare the contract data, format the Awarded_Amount as dollar
contract <- Contract_data %>%
  select(
    RFx_Type,
    High_Level_Category,
    Successful_Supplier,
    Awarded_Amount,

    Small_Business
  ) %>%
  mutate(Awarded_Amount = dollar_format()(Awarded_Amount))  # Format Awarded_Amount as dollar

# Create the table
contract %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Data Preview", 
    align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'r', 'l', 'l'),  # Align columns properly
    col.names = c(
      "RFx Type", 
      "High Level Category", 
      "Successful Supplier", 
      "Awarded Amount ($)", 
      "Award Date", 
      "Small Business"
    )
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 8, 
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1.5in") %>%  # Adjust width of Awarded Amount
  column_spec(5, width = "1.5in") %>%  # Adjust width of Award Date
  column_spec(6, width = "1.2in") %>%  # Adjust width of Small Business column
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")  # Add scroll box if rendering in HTML or PDF
Changes made:
Adjusted the align parameter in the kable function to make sure the columns are properly aligned (left for text and right for numeric values).
Reduced the width for columns "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" by specifying smaller width values using column_spec().
This should reduce the space between the columns and help the table look more compact.

To ensure the table fits properly in a PDF without excessive space between columns, you can fine-tune the column widths further and adjust the font size. Here's an updated version of your code:

r
Copy code
# Prepare the contract data, format the Awarded_Amount as dollar
contract <- Contract_data %>%
  select(
    RFx_Type,
    High_Level_Category,
    Successful_Supplier,
    Awarded_Amount,
    Award_Date,
    Small_Business
  ) %>%
  mutate(Awarded_Amount = dollar_format()(Awarded_Amount))  # Format Awarded_Amount as dollar

# Create the table
contract %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Data Preview", 
    align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'r', 'l', 'l'),  # Proper alignment for each column
    col.names = c(
      "RFx Type", 
      "High Level Category", 
      "Successful Supplier", 
      "Awarded Amount ($)", 
      "Award Date", 
      "Small Business"
    )
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 7,  # Decrease font size for PDF fitting
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Awarded Amount column
  column_spec(5, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Award Date column
  column_spec(6, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Small Business column
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")  # Add scroll box if rendering in HTML or PDF
Key Adjustments:
Column Width: Reduced the column width for "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" to 1 inch to minimize space.
Font Size: Lowered the font size to 7 to make the table more compact and fit better in a PDF.
Alignment: Ensured that text columns (like RFx_Type and Successful_Supplier) are left-aligned ('l') and numerical ones (like Awarded Amount) are right-aligned ('r').
This should help make the table fit into the PDF without leaving too much space between the columns.

To ensure that the table fits in a PDF when using kable with LaTeX, we can apply additional formatting to control the width of the table and avoid it spilling over. Specifically, you can use the resizebox function in LaTeX to scale the table, and adjust column widths as needed. Here’s how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
#| label: tbl-Table2
#| tbl-cap: Logistic regression results 
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Logistic regression model
log_model <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount, 
                 data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

# Tidy the model output for a table
log_model_summary <- broom::tidy(log_model)

# Add odds ratios (exponentiated coefficients) and confidence intervals
log_model_summary <- log_model_summary %>%
  mutate(Odds_Ratio = exp(estimate)) %>%
  mutate(Lower_CI = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         Upper_CI = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error))

# Display the table with resizing for PDF
kable(
  log_model_summary %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, Odds_Ratio, Lower_CI, Upper_CI, p.value),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Small Business Contracts",
  col.names = c("Term", "Log Odds", "Std. Error", 
                "Odds Ratio", "Lower CI", "Upper CI", "P-Value"),
  digits = 4, align = "c"
) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  # Resize the table to fit within the page
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Logistic Regression Results" = 6)) %>%
  row_spec(1:10, font_size = 8) %>%
  # Apply resizebox for LaTeX
  row_spec(0, font_size = 8) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  # Use LaTeX resizebox for larger tables
  column_spec(1, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(6, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(7, width = "1in") %>%
  # Resize the table to fit in PDF output
  kableExtra::add_latex_table() %>%
  kableExtra::resizebox(width = "1.0\\textwidth")
This code ensures the table fits within the page by adjusting the column widths and using the LaTeX resizebox function. Additionally, the font_size is adjusted to a smaller value for better readability in the PDF format.

It appears that resizebox is not available in the kableExtra package. However, you can use the LaTeX resizebox function directly within your LaTeX output. To fit the table properly in the PDF, you can use the kableExtra's latex_options = c("scale_down") argument to scale the table automatically if needed. Here's how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
kable(
  log_model_summary %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, Odds_Ratio, Lower_CI, Upper_CI, p.value),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Small Business Contracts",
  col.names = c("Term", "Log Odds", "Std. Error", 
                "Odds Ratio", "Lower CI", "Upper CI", "P-Value"),
  digits = 4, align = "c"
) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
    latex_options = c("scale_down")  # Automatically scales the table for PDF output
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50")
This code will automatically scale down the table if it overflows in the PDF output, ensuring it fits properly.

can you edit the writing for me, An alternative model considered was Random Forest regression, which does not assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. However, logistic regression was chosen for its interpretability and the specific need to estimate odds ratios, which can provide meaningful insights for policy recommendations. Thus, there is some limitation of the model. The model assumes that the relationships between the predictors and the outcome are linear in the log-odds scale. If this assumption does not hold, the model may not fully capture the complexity of the data. The dataset is limited by its public nature, and variables such as supplier ownership or firm history are not included. These could provide additional insights into small business participation but are not available in the dataset.

Additionally, the dataset is constrained by its public nature, and certain potentially important variables, such as supplier ownership or firm history, are not included. These factors could provide further insights into small business participation, but they are unavailable in the current dataset.

Key Edits:
Flow & Clarity: Adjusted the sentence structure to improve readability and flow.
Details: Clarified the reasoning behind choosing logistic regression and the model's limitations.
Tone: Made the tone more formal and precise while preserving the original meaning.

Updated response for question 9 in the datasheet:

Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.

Occasional data entry errors or inconsistencies in vendor classifications. For instance, the same supplier's name might be entered differently (e.g., "KMPG" and "KPMG LLP"), leading to potential redundancy and challenges in analysis. This highlights a need for data cleaning and normalization to ensure accuracy and consistency.

13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The data doesn't not have any sub-population it self, however the data can be classif vendors into small businesses or not by resreaching the supplier names and determine if they fit into small or large by cretain cretia such as Market Captilization and etc.

The dataset itself does not include explicit sub-populations such as age or gender. However, vendors can be classified into categories such as small or large businesses by researching supplier names and applying criteria like market capitalization or employee count. This classification would need external validation and is not directly available within the dataset.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The dataset should not be used for personal or sensitive data analysis, as it doesn't contain confidential or sensitive individual information. It may also not be appropriate for uses that involve predicting future procurement patterns or making decisions that rely on potentially incomplete or inconsistent vendor classifications, as some vendor data may require external validation. Furthermore, the dataset is specific to Toronto's procurement processes and may not be applicable to other jurisdictions without careful adaptation.
