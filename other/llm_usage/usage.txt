Here’s an R script to clean and prepare your dataset for analysis, focusing on key issues like missing values, filtering out irrelevant entries, and standardizing supplier names. This assumes your dataset is in a CSV file named toronto_contracts.csv.

R Script for Cleaning the Dataset
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)       # For data manipulation
library(tidyr)       # For handling missing data
library(stringr)     # For string operations
library(readr)       # For reading CSV files

# Step 1: Load the dataset
file_path <- "toronto_contracts.csv"  # Adjust the file name/path as needed
contracts <- read_csv(file_path)

# Step 2: Inspect the dataset
glimpse(contracts)  # Get an overview of the dataset
summary(contracts)  # Summary of numeric fields
head(contracts)     # View the first few rows

# Step 3: Handle missing values
# Drop rows where critical fields are missing
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Awarded.Amount) & Awarded.Amount > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Awarded.Amount
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))                     # Remove rows with missing supplier names

# Step 4: Standardize supplier names
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Successful.Supplier = str_to_title(Successful.Supplier))  # Standardize supplier names to Title Case

# Step 5: Remove duplicates
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  distinct()  # Remove exact duplicate rows

# Step 6: Filter relevant fields (optional)
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  select(
    Document.Number,
    RFx.Type,
    High.Level.Category,
    Successful.Supplier,
    Awarded.Amount,
    Award.Date,
    Division
  )

# Step 7: Check for potential small business indicators (optional)
# For instance, you might classify small businesses based on Awarded.Amount threshold
small_business_threshold <- 100000  # Example: Define small business threshold
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Is.Small.Business = ifelse(Awarded.Amount <= small_business_threshold, TRUE, FALSE))

# Step 8: Save the cleaned data to a new CSV
write_csv(contracts_cleaned, "toronto_contracts_cleaned.csv")

# Step 9: Summary of cleaned data
summary(contracts_cleaned)
Explanation of Steps
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset for analysis.
Inspect: Use glimpse() and summary() to understand the structure of your data.
Handle Missing Values: Remove rows where critical fields like Awarded.Amount or Successful.Supplier are missing.
Standardize Supplier Names: Use str_to_title() to make supplier names consistent.
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate rows to avoid double-counting.
Filter Relevant Fields: Retain only the fields necessary for your analysis.
Classify Small Businesses (Optional): Add a column to flag contracts likely awarded to small businesses.
Save Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
Let me know if you need help customizing this script further or analyzing the cleaned data!

The error indicates that the column name Awarded.Amount does not match the actual column name in your dataset. This could be due to differences in capitalization, spelling, or punctuation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

Steps to Fix
Inspect the Column Names: Check the actual column names in your dataset using the following code:

r
Copy code
colnames(contracts)
Locate the Correct Column Name: Identify the column name corresponding to Awarded.Amount (it might be something like Awarded_Amount or Award Amount).

Replace Awarded.Amount with the Correct Name: Update the script to use the correct column name.

Updated Code
Assuming the correct column name is Award.Value (based on the dataset description), replace Awarded.Amount with Award.Value:

r
Copy code
# Step 3: Handle missing values
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Award.Value) & Award.Value > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Award.Value
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))               # Remove rows with missing supplier names
Debugging Tips
If you're unsure about the column names:

Use names(contracts) or colnames(contracts) to inspect them.
Check for typos, spaces, or special characters.
Full Inspection Code Example
r
Copy code
# Check the column names
colnames(contracts)

# Check a few rows to verify
head(contracts)
Let me know the column names if you're still facing issues, and I can adjust the code accordingly!

To simulate a dataset similar to the one you've shown, you can generate random data based on the patterns and structure of the columns in your original raw_data dataset.

Below is an R code that simulates a new dataset based on your cleaned data (raw_data), generating random values for the columns like Document_Number, RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, Division, and Small_Business.

This code will use the structure of the columns in your original dataset to simulate similar observations:

R Code to Simulate Data
r
Copy code
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility

# Example data for simulation
document_numbers <- unique(raw_data$Document_Number)  # Use unique document numbers from your dataset
rfx_types <- c("RFQ", "RFP", "RFSQ")  # Common RFx Types
high_level_categories <- unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category)  # Use categories from original data
suppliers <- unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier)  # List of suppliers
divisions <- unique(raw_data$Division)  # Divisions from the original data
small_business_options <- c(TRUE, FALSE)  # Small Business status

# Simulating Awarded Amounts (random values within a specified range)
award_amount_range <- c(500000, 50000000)  # Example range for Awarded Amount (e.g., between 500k and 50M)

# Randomly simulate Award Dates (e.g., within the last 2 years)
award_dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2022-01-01"), to = Sys.Date(), by = "day")

# Simulate new data
n_simulations <- 100  # Number of observations to simulate

simulated_data <- data.frame(
  Document_Number = sample(document_numbers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  RFx_Type = sample(rfx_types, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  High_Level_Category = sample(high_level_categories, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Successful_Supplier = sample(suppliers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Awarded_Amount = runif(n_simulations, min = award_amount_range[1], max = award_amount_range[2]),
  Award_Date = sample(award_dates, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Division = sample(divisions, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Small_Business = sample(small_business_options, n_simulations, replace = TRUE)
)


can you write me some code to test this simulated data.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! To test your simulated data, you can write some code to perform a few common data validation checks. These tests can help verify that the simulated data is generated correctly and adheres to the expected structure and constraints.

Here are some common tests and checks you can perform on the simulated data:

Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset.
Check for expected distributions in certain columns (e.g., random sampling of categories).
Check the range of numeric columns, like Awarded_Amount.
Check the type and structure of each column (e.g., ensuring that dates are in the correct format).
Check for duplicates in important columns like Document_Number.
Example Testing Code:
r
Copy code
# Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(simulated_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check the range of Awarded_Amount (should be between the specified range)
cat("\nRange of Awarded_Amount:\n")
cat("Min:", min(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if the 'Awarded_Amount' is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000)
award_range_check <- all(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount >= 500000 & simulated_data$Awarded_Amount <= 50000000)
cat("\nAwarded_Amount is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000):", award_range_check, "\n")

# Check the distribution of 'RFx_Type' values
cat("\nDistribution of RFx_Type:\n")
print(table(simulated_data$RFx_Type))

# Check the distribution of 'Small_Business' values
cat("\nDistribution of Small_Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(table(simulated_data$Small_Business))

# Check if 'Award_Date' is of Date type and within a reasonable range (last two years)
cat("\nCheck 'Award_Date' type and range:\n")
cat("Is Award_Date of Date type? ", is.Date(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Earliest Award Date:", min(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Latest Award Date:", max(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")

# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number'
duplicates <- any(duplicated(simulated_data$Document_Number))
cat("\nAre there duplicates in Document_Number?", duplicates, "\n")

# Check for expected number of unique values in key categorical columns
cat("\nNumber of unique 'RFx_Type' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$RFx_Type)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'High_Level_Category' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$High_Level_Category)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Division' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Division)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Successful_Supplier' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Successful_Supplier)), "\n")


You said: 
can you write me some test for the cleand data. 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a set of tests you can perform on your cleaned data (raw_data after the cleaning steps). These tests will check various aspects such as the structure of the data, the validity of specific columns, and whether the cleaning steps have been applied correctly.

Assumptions for Tests:
The dataset has been cleaned (empty rows removed, column names adjusted).
Columns like Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, and Successful_Supplier are correctly formatted.
The column names have been renamed (e.g., "RFx (Solicitation) Type" to "RFx_Type").
Tests for the Cleaned Data:
1. Check for Missing Values
Ensure that there are no missing values in critical columns (e.g., Document_Number, RFx_Type, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date).

r
Copy code
# Check for missing values in key columns
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(raw_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check if there are missing values in 'Awarded_Amount', 'RFx_Type', 'Award_Date', and 'Document_Number'
critical_columns <- c("Document_Number", "RFx_Type", "Awarded_Amount", "Award_Date")
missing_critical <- colSums(is.na(raw_data[, critical_columns]))
cat("\nMissing values in critical columns:\n")
print(missing_critical)
2. Check for Duplicates
Verify that there are no duplicate values in Document_Number and Unique_ID. These should likely be unique identifiers.

r
Copy code
# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number' and 'Unique_ID'
duplicates_document_number <- any(duplicated(raw_data$Document_Number))
duplicates_unique_id <- any(duplicated(raw_data$unique_id))

cat("\nAre there duplicates in 'Document_Number'?", duplicates_document_number, "\n")
cat("Are there duplicates in 'Unique_ID'?", duplicates_unique_id, "\n")
3. Check for Valid Range of Awarded_Amount
Ensure that Awarded_Amount has reasonable values (e.g., no negative or zero amounts).

r
Copy code
# Check the range of 'Awarded_Amount'
cat("\nRange of 'Awarded_Amount':\n")
cat("Min:", min(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if any values in 'Awarded_Amount' are zero or negative
invalid_award_amount <- any(raw_data$Awarded_Amount <= 0)
cat("\nAre there any zero or negative values in 'Awarded_Amount'?", invalid_award_amount, "\n")
4. Check Data Types
Make sure that the data types are correct for each column. For example, Award_Date should be a Date type, and Awarded_Amount should be numeric.

r
Copy code
# Check data types of important columns
cat("\nData Types of Important Columns:\n")
cat("Award_Date is Date type:", is.Date(as.Date(raw_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Awarded_Amount is numeric:", is.numeric(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("RFx_Type is character:", is.character(raw_data$RFx_Type), "\n")
cat("Successful_Supplier is character:", is.character(raw_data$Successful_Supplier), "\n")
cat("Division is character:", is.character(raw_data$Division), "\n")
5. Check Valid Date Range for Award_Date
Ensure that the Award_Date falls within a reasonable time range, e.g., it should not be in the future or too far in the past (e.g., before 2000).

r
Copy code
# Check if 'Award_Date' is within a valid range (e.g., between 2000 and the current date)
valid_award_date_range <- all(raw_data$Award_Date >= as.Date("2000-01-01") & raw_data$Award_Date <= Sys.Date())

cat("\nAre all 'Award_Date' values within the valid range?", valid_award_date_range, "\n")
6. Check for Consistent Categories
Check that the categories in RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, and Division are consistent and match the expected values.

r
Copy code
# Check the unique values for important categorical columns
cat("\nUnique Values in 'RFx_Type':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$RFx_Type))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'High_Level_Category':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Division':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Division))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Successful_Supplier':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier))
7. Check Proportions of Small Business
If Small_Business is a critical column, check the proportions of TRUE/FALSE values to ensure they are within reasonable expectations.

r
Copy code
# Check the proportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE)
small_business_proportion <- table(raw_data$Small_Business)
cat("\nProportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(small_business_proportion)
8. Check Document Number Uniqueness
Ensure that Document_Number is unique, assuming it should be a unique identifier.

r
Copy code
# Check for unique Document Numbers
unique_documents <- length(unique(raw_data$Document_Number))
total_documents <- nrow(raw_data)

cat("\nAre 'Document_Number' unique?", unique_documents == total_documents, "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Document_Number':", unique_documents, "\n")
cat("Total number of rows:", total_documents, "\n")
