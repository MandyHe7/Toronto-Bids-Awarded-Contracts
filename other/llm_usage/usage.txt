Step 1: Preparing the Dataset; can you write me a r code to clean the data 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s an R script to clean and prepare your dataset for analysis, focusing on key issues like missing values, filtering out irrelevant entries, and standardizing supplier names. This assumes your dataset is in a CSV file named toronto_contracts.csv.

R Script for Cleaning the Dataset
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)       # For data manipulation
library(tidyr)       # For handling missing data
library(stringr)     # For string operations
library(readr)       # For reading CSV files

# Step 1: Load the dataset
file_path <- "toronto_contracts.csv"  # Adjust the file name/path as needed
contracts <- read_csv(file_path)

# Step 2: Inspect the dataset
glimpse(contracts)  # Get an overview of the dataset
summary(contracts)  # Summary of numeric fields
head(contracts)     # View the first few rows

# Step 3: Handle missing values
# Drop rows where critical fields are missing
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Awarded.Amount) & Awarded.Amount > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Awarded.Amount
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))                     # Remove rows with missing supplier names

# Step 4: Standardize supplier names
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Successful.Supplier = str_to_title(Successful.Supplier))  # Standardize supplier names to Title Case

# Step 5: Remove duplicates
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  distinct()  # Remove exact duplicate rows

# Step 6: Filter relevant fields (optional)
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  select(
    Document.Number,
    RFx.Type,
    High.Level.Category,
    Successful.Supplier,
    Awarded.Amount,
    Award.Date,
    Division
  )

# Step 7: Check for potential small business indicators (optional)
# For instance, you might classify small businesses based on Awarded.Amount threshold
small_business_threshold <- 100000  # Example: Define small business threshold
contracts_cleaned <- contracts_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Is.Small.Business = ifelse(Awarded.Amount <= small_business_threshold, TRUE, FALSE))

# Step 8: Save the cleaned data to a new CSV
write_csv(contracts_cleaned, "toronto_contracts_cleaned.csv")

# Step 9: Summary of cleaned data
summary(contracts_cleaned)
Explanation of Steps
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset for analysis.
Inspect: Use glimpse() and summary() to understand the structure of your data.
Handle Missing Values: Remove rows where critical fields like Awarded.Amount or Successful.Supplier are missing.
Standardize Supplier Names: Use str_to_title() to make supplier names consistent.
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate rows to avoid double-counting.
Filter Relevant Fields: Retain only the fields necessary for your analysis.
Classify Small Businesses (Optional): Add a column to flag contracts likely awarded to small businesses.
Save Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
Let me know if you need help customizing this script further or analyzing the cleaned data!

The error indicates that the column name Awarded.Amount does not match the actual column name in your dataset. This could be due to differences in capitalization, spelling, or punctuation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

Steps to Fix
Inspect the Column Names: Check the actual column names in your dataset using the following code:

r
Copy code
colnames(contracts)
Locate the Correct Column Name: Identify the column name corresponding to Awarded.Amount (it might be something like Awarded_Amount or Award Amount).

Replace Awarded.Amount with the Correct Name: Update the script to use the correct column name.

Updated Code
Assuming the correct column name is Award.Value (based on the dataset description), replace Awarded.Amount with Award.Value:

r
Copy code
# Step 3: Handle missing values
contracts_cleaned <- contracts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Award.Value) & Award.Value > 0) %>%  # Remove entries with zero or missing Award.Value
  filter(!is.na(Successful.Supplier))               # Remove rows with missing supplier names
Debugging Tips
If you're unsure about the column names:

Use names(contracts) or colnames(contracts) to inspect them.
Check for typos, spaces, or special characters.
Full Inspection Code Example
r
Copy code
# Check the column names
colnames(contracts)

# Check a few rows to verify
head(contracts)
Let me know the column names if you're still facing issues, and I can adjust the code accordingly!

To simulate a dataset similar to the one you've shown, you can generate random data based on the patterns and structure of the columns in your original raw_data dataset.

Below is an R code that simulates a new dataset based on your cleaned data (raw_data), generating random values for the columns like Document_Number, RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, Division, and Small_Business.

This code will use the structure of the columns in your original dataset to simulate similar observations:

R Code to Simulate Data
r
Copy code
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility

# Example data for simulation
document_numbers <- unique(raw_data$Document_Number)  # Use unique document numbers from your dataset
rfx_types <- c("RFQ", "RFP", "RFSQ")  # Common RFx Types
high_level_categories <- unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category)  # Use categories from original data
suppliers <- unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier)  # List of suppliers
divisions <- unique(raw_data$Division)  # Divisions from the original data
small_business_options <- c(TRUE, FALSE)  # Small Business status

# Simulating Awarded Amounts (random values within a specified range)
award_amount_range <- c(500000, 50000000)  # Example range for Awarded Amount (e.g., between 500k and 50M)

# Randomly simulate Award Dates (e.g., within the last 2 years)
award_dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2022-01-01"), to = Sys.Date(), by = "day")

# Simulate new data
n_simulations <- 100  # Number of observations to simulate

simulated_data <- data.frame(
  Document_Number = sample(document_numbers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  RFx_Type = sample(rfx_types, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  High_Level_Category = sample(high_level_categories, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Successful_Supplier = sample(suppliers, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Awarded_Amount = runif(n_simulations, min = award_amount_range[1], max = award_amount_range[2]),
  Award_Date = sample(award_dates, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Division = sample(divisions, n_simulations, replace = TRUE),
  Small_Business = sample(small_business_options, n_simulations, replace = TRUE)
)


can you write me some code to test this simulated data.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! To test your simulated data, you can write some code to perform a few common data validation checks. These tests can help verify that the simulated data is generated correctly and adheres to the expected structure and constraints.

Here are some common tests and checks you can perform on the simulated data:

Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset.
Check for expected distributions in certain columns (e.g., random sampling of categories).
Check the range of numeric columns, like Awarded_Amount.
Check the type and structure of each column (e.g., ensuring that dates are in the correct format).
Check for duplicates in important columns like Document_Number.
Example Testing Code:
r
Copy code
# Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(simulated_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check the range of Awarded_Amount (should be between the specified range)
cat("\nRange of Awarded_Amount:\n")
cat("Min:", min(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if the 'Awarded_Amount' is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000)
award_range_check <- all(simulated_data$Awarded_Amount >= 500000 & simulated_data$Awarded_Amount <= 50000000)
cat("\nAwarded_Amount is within the expected range (500,000 - 50,000,000):", award_range_check, "\n")

# Check the distribution of 'RFx_Type' values
cat("\nDistribution of RFx_Type:\n")
print(table(simulated_data$RFx_Type))

# Check the distribution of 'Small_Business' values
cat("\nDistribution of Small_Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(table(simulated_data$Small_Business))

# Check if 'Award_Date' is of Date type and within a reasonable range (last two years)
cat("\nCheck 'Award_Date' type and range:\n")
cat("Is Award_Date of Date type? ", is.Date(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Earliest Award Date:", min(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Latest Award Date:", max(as.Date(simulated_data$Award_Date)), "\n")

# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number'
duplicates <- any(duplicated(simulated_data$Document_Number))
cat("\nAre there duplicates in Document_Number?", duplicates, "\n")

# Check for expected number of unique values in key categorical columns
cat("\nNumber of unique 'RFx_Type' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$RFx_Type)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'High_Level_Category' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$High_Level_Category)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Division' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Division)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Successful_Supplier' categories:", length(unique(simulated_data$Successful_Supplier)), "\n")


You said: 
can you write me some test for the cleand data. 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a set of tests you can perform on your cleaned data (raw_data after the cleaning steps). These tests will check various aspects such as the structure of the data, the validity of specific columns, and whether the cleaning steps have been applied correctly.

Assumptions for Tests:
The dataset has been cleaned (empty rows removed, column names adjusted).
Columns like Awarded_Amount, Award_Date, and Successful_Supplier are correctly formatted.
The column names have been renamed (e.g., "RFx (Solicitation) Type" to "RFx_Type").
Tests for the Cleaned Data:
1. Check for Missing Values
Ensure that there are no missing values in critical columns (e.g., Document_Number, RFx_Type, Awarded_Amount, Award_Date).

r
Copy code
# Check for missing values in key columns
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(raw_data))
cat("Missing Values:\n")
print(missing_values)

# Check if there are missing values in 'Awarded_Amount', 'RFx_Type', 'Award_Date', and 'Document_Number'
critical_columns <- c("Document_Number", "RFx_Type", "Awarded_Amount", "Award_Date")
missing_critical <- colSums(is.na(raw_data[, critical_columns]))
cat("\nMissing values in critical columns:\n")
print(missing_critical)
2. Check for Duplicates
Verify that there are no duplicate values in Document_Number and Unique_ID. These should likely be unique identifiers.

r
Copy code
# Check for duplicates in 'Document_Number' and 'Unique_ID'
duplicates_document_number <- any(duplicated(raw_data$Document_Number))
duplicates_unique_id <- any(duplicated(raw_data$unique_id))

cat("\nAre there duplicates in 'Document_Number'?", duplicates_document_number, "\n")
cat("Are there duplicates in 'Unique_ID'?", duplicates_unique_id, "\n")
3. Check for Valid Range of Awarded_Amount
Ensure that Awarded_Amount has reasonable values (e.g., no negative or zero amounts).

r
Copy code
# Check the range of 'Awarded_Amount'
cat("\nRange of 'Awarded_Amount':\n")
cat("Min:", min(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("Max:", max(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")

# Check if any values in 'Awarded_Amount' are zero or negative
invalid_award_amount <- any(raw_data$Awarded_Amount <= 0)
cat("\nAre there any zero or negative values in 'Awarded_Amount'?", invalid_award_amount, "\n")
4. Check Data Types
Make sure that the data types are correct for each column. For example, Award_Date should be a Date type, and Awarded_Amount should be numeric.

r
Copy code
# Check data types of important columns
cat("\nData Types of Important Columns:\n")
cat("Award_Date is Date type:", is.Date(as.Date(raw_data$Award_Date)), "\n")
cat("Awarded_Amount is numeric:", is.numeric(raw_data$Awarded_Amount), "\n")
cat("RFx_Type is character:", is.character(raw_data$RFx_Type), "\n")
cat("Successful_Supplier is character:", is.character(raw_data$Successful_Supplier), "\n")
cat("Division is character:", is.character(raw_data$Division), "\n")
5. Check Valid Date Range for Award_Date
Ensure that the Award_Date falls within a reasonable time range, e.g., it should not be in the future or too far in the past (e.g., before 2000).

r
Copy code
# Check if 'Award_Date' is within a valid range (e.g., between 2000 and the current date)
valid_award_date_range <- all(raw_data$Award_Date >= as.Date("2000-01-01") & raw_data$Award_Date <= Sys.Date())

cat("\nAre all 'Award_Date' values within the valid range?", valid_award_date_range, "\n")
6. Check for Consistent Categories
Check that the categories in RFx_Type, High_Level_Category, Successful_Supplier, and Division are consistent and match the expected values.

r
Copy code
# Check the unique values for important categorical columns
cat("\nUnique Values in 'RFx_Type':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$RFx_Type))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'High_Level_Category':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$High_Level_Category))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Division':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Division))

cat("\nUnique Values in 'Successful_Supplier':\n")
print(unique(raw_data$Successful_Supplier))
7. Check Proportions of Small Business
If Small_Business is a critical column, check the proportions of TRUE/FALSE values to ensure they are within reasonable expectations.

r
Copy code
# Check the proportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE)
small_business_proportion <- table(raw_data$Small_Business)
cat("\nProportion of Small Business (TRUE/FALSE):\n")
print(small_business_proportion)
8. Check Document Number Uniqueness
Ensure that Document_Number is unique, assuming it should be a unique identifier.

r
Copy code
# Check for unique Document Numbers
unique_documents <- length(unique(raw_data$Document_Number))
total_documents <- nrow(raw_data)

cat("\nAre 'Document_Number' unique?", unique_documents == total_documents, "\n")
cat("Number of unique 'Document_Number':", unique_documents, "\n")
cat("Total number of rows:", total_documents, "\n")


how to make the division, up down instead of side side: log(1−P(Small_Business=1)/P(Small_Business=1))= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{RFx\_Type} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{High\_Level\_Category} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Awarded\_Amount})

This uses the \frac{numerator}{denominator} command in LaTeX to represent the division vertically, making it appear as a fraction.

Explanation:
\log is used to denote the logarithm.
The \frac{} command makes the fraction, placing the numerator above the denominator.
The terms inside the parentheses represent the fraction you were trying to write, i.e., the ratio between 
1
−
P
(
Small_Business
=

)
1−P(Small_Business=1) and 
P
(

P(Small_Business=1).
This LaTeX code should give you the equation in a more readable, vertically arranged format for the division.

how how is it in that code 
ChatGPT said:
I see what you're asking now — you want to know how to incorporate the LaTeX code properly for the "up-and-down" division within your expression. Here's how the division (with terms stacked vertically) looks in the LaTeX code:

latex
Copy code
\log\left( \frac{1 - P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}{P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{RFx\_Type} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{High\_Level\_Category} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Awarded\_Amount}
Explanation:
\log represents the logarithmic function.
\frac{} is the LaTeX command to create fractions (the division). The first argument inside the brackets is the numerator (the part on top), and the second argument is the denominator (the part on the bottom).
The division you wanted to represent is between 
1
−
P
(
Small_Business
=
1
)
1−P(Small_Business=1) and 
P
(
Small_Business
=

P(Small_Business=1), so it is written as \frac{1 - P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}{P(\text{Small\_Business} = 1)}.

can you code me some Model Fit Diagnostics
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here are some common model fit diagnostics for logistic regression in R, along with code examples you can apply to your model:

1. Check Model Fit Using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
The AIC is a measure of model quality, where lower values indicate a better fit while penalizing for model complexity.

r
Copy code
# Display AIC for the logistic model
AIC(log_model)
How to Interpret:
Compare the AIC value with other models (e.g., models with fewer or additional predictors). A lower AIC indicates better performance.
2. Hosmer-Lemeshow Test
This test checks if the observed outcomes match the predicted probabilities. It’s particularly useful for logistic regression models.

Install the required package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("ResourceSelection")
library(ResourceSelection)

# Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
hl_test <- hoslem.test(log_model$y, fitted(log_model), g = 10)  # g is the number of groups
hl_test
How to Interpret:
The test returns a p-value.
A p-value > 0.05 indicates the model fits well (observed and predicted values align closely).
A p-value ≤ 0.05 suggests poor fit.
3. Pseudo R-Squared (McFadden's R²)
McFadden’s R² is a pseudo R² value used for logistic regression to indicate how much variance is explained by the model.

Install the pscl package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("pscl")
library(pscl)

# Pseudo R-squared values
pscl::pR2(log_model)
Output:
The McFadden value is most commonly used.
Values between 0.2–0.4 indicate a good model fit for logistic regression.
4. Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
Evaluate how well the model classifies outcomes (small vs. large business) by creating a confusion matrix.

r
Copy code
# Create predicted probabilities
predicted_probs <- predict(log_model, type = "response")

# Set a threshold to classify (e.g., 0.5)
predicted_classes <- ifelse(predicted_probs > 0.5, TRUE, FALSE)

# Create a confusion matrix
table(Predicted = predicted_classes, Actual = Contract_data$Small_Business)

# Calculate accuracy
mean(predicted_classes == Contract_data$Small_Business)
How to Interpret:
The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified observations. Higher is better, but be cautious if the classes are imbalanced.
5. ROC Curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate vs. false positive rate, and AUC summarizes the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

Install the pROC package:

r
Copy code
install.packages("pROC")
library(pROC)

# Generate ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(Contract_data$Small_Business, predicted_probs)

# Plot the ROC curve
plot(roc_curve, col = "blue", lwd = 2, main = "ROC Curve")

# Calculate AUC
auc(roc_curve)
How to Interpret:
AUC ranges from 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination).
A value above 0.7 indicates a good model, while values above 0.8 suggest strong performance.
6. Residual Deviance
Residual deviance compares the model’s deviance to the null model (a model with no predictors). Lower residual deviance indicates a better fit.

r
Copy code
# Null deviance (model with no predictors)
log_model$null.deviance

# Residual deviance (current model)
log_model$deviance
How to Interpret:
Subtract residual deviance from null deviance to check how much better your model is compared to the null model.
Use a chi-squared test to assess statistical significance:
r
Copy code
df <- log_model$df.null - log_model$df.residual
p_value <- pchisq(log_model$null.deviance - log_model$deviance, df, lower.tail = FALSE)
p_value
A p-value < 0.05 indicates the model significantly improves over the null model.
Summary
These diagnostics help assess various aspects of your logistic regression model:

AIC evaluates the overall fit and complexity.
Hosmer-Lemeshow Test checks the goodness of fit.
Pseudo R² provides variance explained.
Confusion Matrix and Accuracy assess classification performance.
ROC and AUC measure the model's discrimination power.
Residual Deviance compares the model to a baseline.
Run these tests and interpret the outputs to validate your model and its ability to answer the research question effectively.

To display the models and their AIC values side by side in a table, you can use the broom package to tidy up the information and knitr::kable to format it as a table. Here's the R code:

R
Copy code
# Fit the logistic regression models
log_model <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount, 
                 data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

log_model2 <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category, 
                  data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

log_model3 <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount + RFx_Type * Awarded_Amount, 
                  data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

# Extract model AIC values
model_comparison <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Model 1: Base Model", 
            "Model 2: Without Awarded_Amount", 
            "Model 3: Interaction Term"),
  AIC = c(AIC(log_model), 
          AIC(log_model2), 
          AIC(log_model3))
)

# Display the table
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

model_comparison %>%
  kable(
    caption = "AIC Comparison of Logistic Regression Models",
    col.names = c("Model Description", "AIC"),
    align = c("l", "c"),
    digits = 2
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
Explanation:
Model Fitting: The three models (log_model, log_model2, and log_model3) are fitted with different specifications.
AIC Extraction: AIC() extracts the AIC values of each model, which are stored in a data frame.
Table Creation: knitr::kable is used to create the table with appropriate formatting, and kableExtra adds styling for better visualization.
This will produce a styled table displaying the AIC values for each model, helping you compare model fits. Let me know if you need additional customization!

ChatGPT said:
To format the date range as "day to day" (e.g., "2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31"), you can use the paste() function in R to combine the Min_Date and Max_Date values into a single string in the desired format.

Here's how you can modify your code:

Modifying the Code to Format the Date Range:
After extracting the Min_Date and Max_Date, you will concatenate them using paste().
Format the dates as needed (e.g., using format() to ensure a consistent format like "YYYY-MM-DD").
Updated Code for Date Range:
r
Copy code
# Calculate Date Range and format it as "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"
date_range <- Contract_data %>%
  summarise(
    Min_Date = min(Award_Date, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Date = max(Award_Date, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Format the date range as "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"
formatted_date_range <- paste(
  format(date_range$Min_Date, "%Y-%m-%d"),  # Format Min_Date
  "to",
  format(date_range$Max_Date, "%Y-%m-%d")   # Format Max_Date
)

# 1. General Information Table (Summary Stats + Date Range + Small/Large Business Count)
general_info_table <- tibble(
  Metric = c(
    "Min Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Max Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Avg Total Awarded Amount", 
    "Award Date Range",  # Update label to "Award Date Range"
    "Small Business Count", 
    "Large Business Count"
  ),
  Value = c(
    min_total_awarded_amount, 
    max_total_awarded_amount, 
    avg_total_awarded_amount,
    formatted_date_range,   # Use the formatted date range
    Small,
    Big
  )
)

# Print General Information Table (Summary Stats + Date Range + Small/Large Business Count)
general_info_table %>%
  kable(
    caption = "General Information Summary",
    align = 'l',
    col.names = c("Metric", "Value")  # Ensure column names match the number of columns
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50")
Explanation:
Formatting Dates:
format(date_range$Min_Date, "%Y-%m-%d"): This formats the Min_Date as YYYY-MM-DD.
paste() combines the formatted Min_Date with Max_Date to create a string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD".
Updated Metric Label:
I updated "Min Award Date" and "Max Award Date" to a single entry: "Award Date Range", as you want to display the date range in a single cell.
Example Output:
Assuming your Min_Date is 2020-01-01 and Max_Date is 2024-12-31, the table will show something like:

Metric	Value
Min Total Awarded Amount	1000
Max Total Awarded Amount	5000
Avg Total Awarded Amount	2500
Award Date Range	2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31
Small Business Count	200
Large Business Count	50
This way, the date range is formatted as you requested. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

ChatGPT
To display the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test results in a table, you can extract the key elements from the hl_test object and format them into a data frame. Then, you can use knitr::kable to present the results. Here's the code:

R
Copy code
# Perform the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
library(ResourceSelection)
hl_test <- hoslem.test(log_model$y, fitted(log_model), g = 10)

# Extract test results into a data frame

  Statistic = c("Chi-squared", "Degrees of Freedom", "P-value"),
  Value = c(hl_test$statistic, hl_test$parameter, hl_test$p.value)
)

# Display the table

    align = c("l", "c"),
    digits = 4
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
Explanation:
hl_test Execution: This performs the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, testing the model's goodness-of-fit.
Result Extraction: The key metrics—chi-squared statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value—are extracted from the hl_test object and stored in a data frame.
Table Formatting: knitr::kable and kableExtra are used to present the results in a clear and visually appealing table.
The resulting table will include the chi-squared value, degrees of freedom, and p-value, providing insights into the goodness of fit for the logistic regression model.

  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
Explanation:
Metric Calculations:

null_deviance: Deviance of the model with no predictors.
residual_deviance: Deviance of the fitted model.
df: Degrees of freedom used in the comparison.
p_value: Derived from the chi-squared test comparing the null and residual deviances.
Formatting the Table:

The data.frame organizes the results.
kable and kableExtra create a clean, visually appealing table.
Output:
The table will include:

Null Deviance: The baseline deviance.
Residual Deviance: The deviance of your fitted model.
Degrees of Freedom: Difference in degrees of freedom between the models.
P-Value: Indicates whether the predictors significantly improve the model fit.

To adjust the spacing between columns in your table so that the columns for "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" are not too far apart, you can tweak the column widths and alignment further. Here's how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
# Prepare the contract data, format the Awarded_Amount as dollar
contract <- Contract_data %>%
  select(
    RFx_Type,
    High_Level_Category,
    Successful_Supplier,
    Awarded_Amount,
    Award_Date,
    Small_Business
  ) %>%
  mutate(Awarded_Amount = dollar_format()(Awarded_Amount))  # Format Awarded_Amount as dollar

# Create the table
contract %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Data Preview", 
    align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'r', 'l', 'l'),  # Align columns properly
    col.names = c(
      "RFx Type", 
      "High Level Category", 
      "Successful Supplier", 
      "Awarded Amount ($)", 
      "Award Date", 
      "Small Business"
    )
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 8, 
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1.5in") %>%  # Adjust width of Awarded Amount
  column_spec(5, width = "1.5in") %>%  # Adjust width of Award Date
  column_spec(6, width = "1.2in") %>%  # Adjust width of Small Business column
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")  # Add scroll box if rendering in HTML or PDF
Changes made:
Adjusted the align parameter in the kable function to make sure the columns are properly aligned (left for text and right for numeric values).
Reduced the width for columns "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" by specifying smaller width values using column_spec().
This should reduce the space between the columns and help the table look more compact.

To ensure the table fits properly in a PDF without excessive space between columns, you can fine-tune the column widths further and adjust the font size. Here's an updated version of your code:

r
Copy code
# Prepare the contract data, format the Awarded_Amount as dollar
contract <- Contract_data %>%
  select(
    RFx_Type,
    High_Level_Category,
    Successful_Supplier,
    Awarded_Amount,
    Award_Date,
    Small_Business
  ) %>%
  mutate(Awarded_Amount = dollar_format()(Awarded_Amount))  # Format Awarded_Amount as dollar

# Create the table
contract %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Data Preview", 
    align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'r', 'l', 'l'),  # Proper alignment for each column
    col.names = c(
      "RFx Type", 
      "High Level Category", 
      "Successful Supplier", 
      "Awarded Amount ($)", 
      "Award Date", 
      "Small Business"
    )
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 7,  # Decrease font size for PDF fitting
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Awarded Amount column
  column_spec(5, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Award Date column
  column_spec(6, width = "1in") %>%  # Narrow down width for Small Business column
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")  # Add scroll box if rendering in HTML or PDF
Key Adjustments:
Column Width: Reduced the column width for "Awarded Amount", "Award Date", and "Small Business" to 1 inch to minimize space.
Font Size: Lowered the font size to 7 to make the table more compact and fit better in a PDF.
Alignment: Ensured that text columns (like RFx_Type and Successful_Supplier) are left-aligned ('l') and numerical ones (like Awarded Amount) are right-aligned ('r').
This should help make the table fit into the PDF without leaving too much space between the columns.

To ensure that the table fits in a PDF when using kable with LaTeX, we can apply additional formatting to control the width of the table and avoid it spilling over. Specifically, you can use the resizebox function in LaTeX to scale the table, and adjust column widths as needed. Here’s how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
#| label: tbl-Table2
#| tbl-cap: Logistic regression results 
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Logistic regression model
log_model <- glm(Small_Business ~ RFx_Type + High_Level_Category + Awarded_Amount, 
                 data = Contract_data, family = binomial)

# Tidy the model output for a table
log_model_summary <- broom::tidy(log_model)

# Add odds ratios (exponentiated coefficients) and confidence intervals
log_model_summary <- log_model_summary %>%
  mutate(Odds_Ratio = exp(estimate)) %>%
  mutate(Lower_CI = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         Upper_CI = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error))

# Display the table with resizing for PDF
kable(
  log_model_summary %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, Odds_Ratio, Lower_CI, Upper_CI, p.value),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Small Business Contracts",
  col.names = c("Term", "Log Odds", "Std. Error", 
                "Odds Ratio", "Lower CI", "Upper CI", "P-Value"),
  digits = 4, align = "c"
) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50") %>%
  # Resize the table to fit within the page
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Logistic Regression Results" = 6)) %>%
  row_spec(1:10, font_size = 8) %>%
  # Apply resizebox for LaTeX
  row_spec(0, font_size = 8) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  # Use LaTeX resizebox for larger tables
  column_spec(1, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "1in") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(6, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(7, width = "1in") %>%
  # Resize the table to fit in PDF output
  kableExtra::add_latex_table() %>%
  kableExtra::resizebox(width = "1.0\\textwidth")
This code ensures the table fits within the page by adjusting the column widths and using the LaTeX resizebox function. Additionally, the font_size is adjusted to a smaller value for better readability in the PDF format.

It appears that resizebox is not available in the kableExtra package. However, you can use the LaTeX resizebox function directly within your LaTeX output. To fit the table properly in the PDF, you can use the kableExtra's latex_options = c("scale_down") argument to scale the table automatically if needed. Here's how you can modify the code:

r
Copy code
kable(
  log_model_summary %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, Odds_Ratio, Lower_CI, Upper_CI, p.value),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Small Business Contracts",
  col.names = c("Term", "Log Odds", "Std. Error", 
                "Odds Ratio", "Lower CI", "Upper CI", "P-Value"),
  digits = 4, align = "c"
) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 10,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
    latex_options = c("scale_down")  # Automatically scales the table for PDF output
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2C3E50")
This code will automatically scale down the table if it overflows in the PDF output, ensuring it fits properly.

edit the grammar for me: Equitable public procurement plays a critical role in fostering inclusive economic development, particularly in large, diverse cities like Toronto. Through its competitive contracting process, the City of Toronto allocates significant resources to suppliers for goods and services, providing essential economic opportunities. For small businesses and historically underrepresented sectors, public contracts represent vital opportunities to grow and succeed. However, ensuring that all suppliers have equal access to these opportunities remains a challenge, as barriers—such as high entry thresholds, limited outreach, and resource disparities—continue to hinder the participation of diverse suppliers, especially small businesses.

This study examines the equity of supplier representation in Toronto’s public procurement system, with a focus on small businesses and underrepresented sectors. By leveraging the Toronto Bids Awarded Contracts data set, the research investigates whether these groups are adequately represented in contract awards. It also analyzes trends related to the value of contracts, with particular attention to which suppliers are winning high-value contracts in sectors like construction services, which tend to favor larger businesses. This paper aims to identify potential disparities in contract access and supplier diversity, providing insights that can inform the development of more equitable procurement policies.

The estimand of this study is the extent to which small businesses face structural barriers in accessing high-value contracts within the City of Toronto’s public procurement system. Specifically, the research aims to quantify disparities in the representation of small businesses in contract awards, with a focus on sectors like "Construction Services" that tend to favor larger firms. By analyzing the Toronto Bids Awarded Contracts dataset, this paper seeks to estimate the difference in contract values awarded to small businesses compared to larger businesses, and the likelihood of small businesses securing contracts in these high-value categories.

Equitable public procurement plays a critical role in fostering inclusive economic development, particularly in large, diverse cities like Toronto. Through its competitive contracting process, the City of Toronto allocates substantial resources to suppliers for goods and services, providing essential economic opportunities. For small businesses and historically underrepresented sectors, public contracts represent vital opportunities for growth and success. However, ensuring equal access to these opportunities remains a challenge, as barriers—such as high entry thresholds, limited outreach, and resource disparities—continue to hinder the participation of diverse suppliers, especially small businesses.

This study examines the equity of supplier representation in Toronto’s public procurement system, with a focus on small businesses and underrepresented sectors. By leveraging the Toronto Bids Awarded Contracts dataset, the research investigates whether these groups are adequately represented in contract awards. It also analyzes trends related to contract values, with particular attention to which suppliers are winning high-value contracts in sectors like construction services, which tend to favor larger businesses. This paper aims to identify potential disparities in contract access and supplier diversity, offering insights that can inform the development of more equitable procurement policies.

To understand how real-world phenomena are captured in a structured dataset, it is important to trace the lifecycle of data collection, organization, and analysis. The Toronto Bids Awarded Contracts dataset begins with the City of Toronto’s procurement process—a fundamental operation for acquiring goods, services, and construction work to meet the city’s public needs. This process encompasses several stages, starting from identifying procurement needs, issuing requests for proposals (RFPs), evaluating bids, and ultimately awarding contracts to successful suppliers. Each of these stages reflects real-world events that are systematically documented and become part of the dataset.

The transition from real-world activity to structured data starts when the City identifies a need, such as for infrastructure development, service enhancements, or administrative support. The procurement process begins by issuing a solicitation document that outlines the scope of work, evaluation criteria, and the specific requirements for the project or service. Suppliers then submit their bids, which are evaluated based on predefined criteria such as cost, quality, and compliance with the project specifications. After evaluating the bids, a contract is awarded to the supplier deemed most suitable for the task. Key details from this decision-making process—such as the contract’s awarded amount, the supplier’s name, and the City division requesting the procurement—are recorded for documentation and analysis purposes.

This recorded information is input into the City's procurement management system, where it is organized into structured attributes that can be analyzed. For example, variables such as RFx Type (Solicitation Type), High-Level Category (e.g., "Construction Services," "Professional Services"), and the Award Date are systematically logged. These details capture essential aspects of the procurement process and serve as a foundation for further analysis. In addition to these basic attributes, supplementary information such as the division involved, buyer contact information, and a summary of the solicitation are included in the dataset to enhance its utility for researchers and policymakers.

Further data processing is performed to enhance the dataset’s analytical value. For instance, the creation of a Small Business (Dummy Variable) allows for a classification of suppliers as either small or large businesses based on contract size or other relevant factors. This variable is constructed from the awarded amounts and company size data, helping to identify potential barriers for small businesses within the procurement system.

Ultimately, the dataset functions as a structured representation of the City’s complex procurement process. Each entry in the dataset reflects decisions, evaluations, and negotiations that occurred in the real world, distilled into numerical and categorical data points. This structured transformation enables researchers, policymakers, and the public to analyze procurement practices, uncover patterns, and assess the equity and efficiency of the City’s contracting system. However, it is important to acknowledge that, while detailed, this dataset is an abstraction—capturing critical aspects of the procurement process while omitting less relevant details for the purposes of this analysis.

The dataset comprises several key variables that are essential for understanding supplier representation in the City’s public procurement process. The primary variables that is of interest for this paper include:

- **RFx Type (Solicitation Type):** The procurement method used for the solicitation, such as Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Tender (RFT), and others. This indicates the process used to seek bids or proposals from suppliers.

- **High-Level Category:** Groups the goods or services being procured, such as Goods and Services, Professional Services, or Construction Services.

- **Successful Supplier:** The name of the supplier awarded the contract.

- **Awarded Amount:** The total monetary value awarded to the supplier for the contract.

- **Award Date:** The date the contract between the City and the supplier was finalized.


In addition to these core variables, a **Small Business (Dummy Variable)** was created to classify suppliers as small (TRUE) or large (FALSE). This binary variable facilitates analysis of whether small businesses have equitable access to procurement opportunities. The classification of small businesses was determined based on contract value thresholds and company size data, as detailed in [Appendix - @sec-appdata].

The dataset offers a robust foundation for exploring supplier equity in public procurement, especially concerning small businesses. However, it is important to note the limitations of the dataset. While it provides significant insights, it lacks detailed data on supplier ownership, firm age, or procurement history, which could enhance the analysis. These additional variables might offer a more granular understanding of procurement practices, but they are not available through Open Data Toronto. Despite these limitations, the Toronto Bids Awarded Contracts dataset remains an essential resource for assessing procurement practices and identifying structural barriers that hinder small businesses, particularly in securing high-value contracts.

Summary statistics have been calculated to understand key trends and relationships between the variables. These statistics help reveal patterns in contract distribution and the number of opportunities awarded to different suppliers, particularly in terms of small versus large businesses. @tbl-Tab, @tbl-Tab2 and @tbl-Tab3 provides an overview of these summary statistics, highlighting how the size of contracts correlates with the type and number of suppliers involved.

- Logistic Regression is chosen for its ability to model binary outcomes, which is appropriate for our research question. It also provides interpretable results, such as odds ratios, which help assess the likelihood of a small business winning a contract based on various predictors.

- RFx_Type and High_Level_Category are categorical variables. In logistic regression, these variables are treated as factors, with each level (category) compared to a baseline (reference) category. This allows us to observe how different solicitation types and procurement categories affect the odds of awarding a contract to a small business.

- The inclusion of Awarded_Amount as a continuous variable accounts for the potential impact of contract size on small business participation. Larger contracts may favor larger businesses, and this variable helps assess that effect.


The model’s fit will be assessed using standard techniques such as AIC, Hosmer-Lemeshow Test, and Residual Deviance. Diagnostics of these tests can be found in @sec-Diagnostics.

In addition, model assumptions such as the linearity of the log-odds and the independence of observations are assumed.

An alternative model that was considered is Random Forest regression, which does not assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. However, logistic regression was ultimately chosen for its interpretability and its ability to estimate odds ratios, which are particularly valuable for deriving actionable insights and making policy recommendations. 

That said, there are some limitations to the model. Specifically, logistic regression assumes that the relationships between the predictors and the outcome are linear on the log-odds scale. If this assumption is not valid, the model may fail to capture the full complexity of the data. Additionally, the dataset is constrained by its public nature, and certain potentially important variables, such as supplier ownership or firm history, are not included. These factors could provide further insights into small business participation, but they are unavailable in the current dataset.

The bar chart @fig-bargraph, illustrates the distribution of the total awarded amounts across various RFx types, revealing several important trends in the procurement process. First, the Request for Tender (RFT) emerges as the dominant procurement method, with a total awarded amount surpassing $1 billion. This indicates that tenders are the primary mechanism used for large-scale city contracts. Following RFT, the Request for Quotation (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP) types each have awarded amounts just below $375 million, showing that while they are significant, they play a secondary role in the procurement landscape. In contrast, other RFx categories such as Non-Request for Proposal (NRFP), Offer to Purchase (OTP), and Request for Supplier Qualification (RFSQ) represent a much smaller share, with their awarded amounts being minimal. This suggests that these methods are infrequently used in the awarding of contracts. Overall, the chart reveals a clear preference for tenders and quotations in the city's procurement activities, with a focus on larger, more formal procurement processes.

This indicates that large-scale projects, such as infrastructure development, are predominant in this category. In contrast, Professional Services and Goods & Services exhibit significantly narrower distributions, with no substantial outliers. These categories are associated with more predictable and uniform expenditure patterns, reflecting their role in smaller, more routine contracts. The Offer to Purchase category, on the other hand, shows minimal representation, with awarded amounts clustered at lower values. This suggests that it is infrequently used for high-value procurement activities.

This bar chart, @fig-bar4, presents the proportion of contracts awarded to small businesses (blue) versus large businesses (red) across major procurement categories, including Construction Services, Goods & Services, Offer to Purchase, and Professional Services. In the Construction Services and Professional Services categories, there is a clear dominance of contracts awarded to large businesses. This suggests that small businesses may face barriers to participation, such as stringent qualification requirements or the scale of projects, which favor larger firms. On the other hand, the Goods & Services and Offer to Purchase categories show a higher proportion of contracts awarded to small businesses. This indicates that these categories are more inclusive, with fewer financial or operational barriers, making them more accessible to smaller enterprises. Overall, these trends highlight the varying levels of inclusivity within different procurement sectors, with some categories offering more opportunities for small businesses to engage in the procurement process.

This bar chart, @fig-bar6, illustrates the average awarded amounts to small businesses and large businesses across high-level contract categories. In the Construction Services category, large businesses dominate, with average awards approaching $30 million, while small businesses receive significantly smaller amounts. This discrepancy suggests that large-scale contracts in this category likely require resources or qualifications that are beyond the capacity of small businesses. In contrast, Goods and Services contracts show a more equitable distribution, with similar average awards for both small and large businesses, indicating that small firms face fewer barriers and can compete more equally in this category. The Offer to Purchase category shows no recorded average awarded amounts, suggesting minimal or no activity in this category within the dataset. In Professional Services, large businesses still receive higher average awards, but the gap is smaller compared to Construction Services. This suggests that while small businesses have some opportunities in this category, disparities in awarded amounts still exist. These findings highlight significant variations in contract accessibility for small businesses across different procurement categories, with some offering more inclusive opportunities than others.

This line graph, @fig-line, depicts the average awarded amounts for small and large businesses over the analyzed period. Large businesses show significant fluctuations in awarded amounts, with sharp peaks in mid-2023 and late 2024. These spikes are likely driven by occasional high-value contracts, which account for the variability in their awards. In contrast, small businesses exhibit a more stable trend, consistently receiving lower awards, generally staying below $10 million. There are minor increases in late 2023 and mid-2024, indicating gradual improvements in the awarded amounts for small businesses during these periods. The overall trends highlight a consistent disparity between small and large businesses, with large businesses capturing the majority of high-value contracts. However, the relatively stable levels of awarded amounts for small businesses suggest that, while their opportunities are limited, there has been a steady, albeit modest, flow of contracts to smaller enterprises.

A logistic regression model was used to assess the factors influencing the likelihood of a contract being awarded to a small business. The results, presented in @tbl-Table2, offer several key insights.

**Impact of Awarded Amount:** Larger awarded amounts are negatively associated with the likelihood of contracts being awarded to small businesses. This suggests a structural bias in favor of larger firms when it comes to high-value contracts, potentially due to the greater resources and capabilities required to handle large-scale projects.

**High-Level Category Influence:** Certain procurement categories, such as "Goods and Services" and "Professional Services," significantly reduce the probability of small businesses winning contracts. These findings point to an uneven playing field in these sectors, likely driven by higher technical, operational, or financial requirements that make it more challenging for smaller enterprises to compete effectively.

**No Significant RFx Impact:** The RFx type (e.g., RFP, RFQ, RFT) did not show a statistically significant effect on the likelihood of small businesses securing contracts. This suggests that other systemic factors, such as vendor eligibility criteria, selection processes, or organizational preferences, may play a more pivotal role in determining the outcomes, rather than the specific procurement method used.

**Implications:**
The findings underscore the substantial barriers faced by small businesses, particularly in securing high-value contracts and in specific procurement categories that demand specialized expertise or resources. To address these disparities, the results suggest the need for targeted reforms aimed at improving access for small businesses. Possible measures could include relaxing eligibility requirements, simplifying bidding processes, or allocating dedicated opportunities for small businesses to help level the playing field in procurement activities.

While the procurement data we analyze is observational in nature, understanding the principles behind survey sampling can enhance our interpretation of the results. Procurement records could be viewed as a form of "sample" of the broader population of potential contracts, and proper sampling techniques could help ensure that our analysis accurately reflects the larger procurement landscape.

**Stratified Sampling in Procurement Data**

Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups or strata based on characteristics of interest, and then sampling from each subgroup. In the context of procurement, strata could be defined by the type of RFx (e.g., RFT, RFQ, RFP), the procurement category (e.g., construction services, professional services), or the size of the business (small vs. large). Using stratified sampling ensures that each category is adequately represented, and that any disparities in contract awards between groups are more accurately assessed.

For example, if small businesses are predominantly represented in RFQ contracts but underrepresented in RFT contracts, stratified analysis would allow for a more precise comparison across procurement categories.

**Random Sampling vs. Observational Data**

While random sampling is a key technique in surveys to ensure unbiased representation, observational data relies on naturally occurring events. In procurement analysis, this means that every contract awarded is treated as part of the population, without any sampling bias, though one must be cautious of other forms of bias that might affect the data collection process (e.g., data reporting biases or timing biases).

In some instances, observational data might miss certain segments of the population (e.g., missed or incomplete contract records), and understanding the limitations of this data is essential. If additional survey methods were employed (e.g., surveying procurement officials or small business owners about their experiences), we could complement the observational data and potentially fill gaps in understanding.

## Challenges in Analyzing Procurement Data: Measurement and Bias Considerations

**Measurement Issues**

The procurement data relies on records that include contract values, RFx types, and business classifications. However, measurement errors can occur due to inconsistent reporting, variations in how contracts are categorized, or incomplete data entries. In this study, careful validation was done to ensure that the data used for analysis is accurate and up-to-date. However, measurement issues should be acknowledged, especially when interpreting trends and making policy recommendations.

For example, discrepancies in how contracts are categorized (e.g., whether a contract is classified as "construction services" versus "goods and services") could influence the interpretation of small business participation across different procurement categories. Moreover, larger contracts might involve multiple suppliers, and the allocation of contract values could be subject to different reporting standards.

**Data-Related Biases**

While observational data avoids some biases inherent in survey methodologies, it can still suffer from selection biases. In the case of procurement data, certain contracts may be more likely to be awarded to large businesses due to the nature of the work (e.g., large-scale infrastructure projects), which could skew the results. Additionally, small businesses may face additional barriers in participating in high-value contracts, which could further distort the data on small business representation.

To address these biases, the study employs regression techniques to control for variables such as awarded amount and procurement category, helping to isolate the impact of business size on contract awards. Further refinement could involve using propensity score matching or other methods to correct for potential selection bias.

Your analysis of procurement data using sampling methods and the consideration of biases is well-articulated. Below is a refined version of your text with some improvements in clarity, coherence, and flow:

Understanding Sampling Methods in Procurement Data Analysis
While the procurement data we analyze is observational, understanding survey sampling principles can enhance our interpretation of the results. Procurement records may be viewed as a form of "sample" from the broader population of potential contracts. By applying proper sampling techniques, we can ensure that our analysis more accurately reflects the larger procurement landscape.

Stratified Sampling in Procurement Data
Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (or strata) based on characteristics of interest, and then sampling from each subgroup. In the context of procurement, strata could be defined by the type of RFx (e.g., RFT, RFQ, RFP), procurement category (e.g., construction services, professional services), or business size (small vs. large). Stratified sampling ensures that each category is adequately represented, improving the accuracy of assessments of disparities in contract awards.

For instance, if small businesses are predominantly represented in RFQ contracts but underrepresented in RFT contracts, stratified analysis would allow for a more precise comparison across procurement categories, helping to uncover systemic barriers that may be affecting small business participation.

Random Sampling vs. Observational Data
While random sampling is a key technique in survey design to ensure unbiased representation, observational data relies on naturally occurring events. In procurement analysis, this means that every contract awarded is treated as part of the population without intentional sampling. However, caution is needed to account for other forms of bias that could affect the data collection process, such as data reporting or timing biases.

Unlike random sampling, observational data may not capture all segments of the population (e.g., missed or incomplete contract records). Thus, the limitations of the data should be carefully considered when drawing conclusions. If additional survey methods were used—such as surveying procurement officials or small business owners about their experiences—this could complement the observational data and provide further insights into potential gaps.

Challenges in Analyzing Procurement Data: Measurement and Bias Considerations
Measurement Issues
Procurement data relies on contract records that include values, RFx types, and business classifications. However, measurement errors can occur due to inconsistent reporting, differences in how contracts are categorized, or incomplete data entries. In this study, we validated the data to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. However, it is important to recognize potential measurement issues, particularly when interpreting trends or making policy recommendations.

For example, discrepancies in how contracts are categorized (e.g., whether a contract is classified as "construction services" versus "goods and services") could influence how small business participation is assessed across different procurement categories. Moreover, some contracts may involve multiple suppliers, which could lead to variations in how contract values are reported.

Data-Related Biases
Although observational data avoids some biases inherent in survey methodologies, it is not immune to selection biases. In procurement, certain contracts may be more likely to be awarded to large businesses due to the scale or complexity of the work (e.g., large infrastructure projects), which could distort our understanding of small business participation. Additionally, small businesses may face greater barriers to participating in high-value contracts, which could further skew the data on their representation.

To address these potential biases, our study employs regression techniques to control for variables like awarded amount and procurement category. This helps isolate the effect of business size on contract awards. However, further refinement of the analysis could include techniques like propensity score matching or other methods to correct for potential selection biases and ensure a more accurate representation of small business participation.

Summary
By considering both sampling methods and potential biases, we can better understand the nuances of procurement data. Stratified sampling helps ensure that all relevant subgroups are represented, while acknowledging biases and measurement issues allows for more accurate interpretations. Though observational data offers valuable insights, combining it with other methods, such as surveys or longitudinal studies, could provide a more comprehensive picture of small business participation in public procurement.

Simulating Procurement Scenarios: Enhancing Predictive Insights
In addition to analyzing existing procurement data, simulating various procurement scenarios can provide valuable insights into the potential impact of policy changes on small business participation. Simulation models enable us to model hypothetical changes in procurement processes and predict how they might affect outcomes, offering a way to explore the future consequences of various policy adjustments before implementation.

Why Simulate Procurement Scenarios?
Simulation is a powerful tool that allows us to evaluate "what-if" scenarios, helping to test the effectiveness of different policy changes. For example, policymakers can use simulations to estimate the effects of simplifying bidding requirements, introducing set-asides for small businesses, or adjusting the criteria for contract eligibility. These predictive models provide a clearer understanding of how such changes could shift the distribution of contracts between small and large businesses, without having to implement costly real-world experiments.

Potential Simulated Scenarios
Small Business Set-Asides for High-Value Contracts
One promising scenario to model is the introduction of small business set-asides, particularly in high-value categories like RFT (Request for Tender) contracts. Currently, RFT contracts tend to favor large businesses due to the significant resources required. Simulating a policy change where a certain percentage of RFT contracts are reserved exclusively for small businesses could provide valuable predictions. The model could estimate the increase in small business participation in these contracts, assess whether small businesses are able to meet the contract requirements, and measure the overall impact on contract distribution.

Simplification of Bidding Processes
Another useful scenario to model is the simplification of bidding processes, especially for more complex contract types such as RFPs (Request for Proposal) or RFTs. Reducing the administrative burden and technical complexity could make these contracts more accessible to small businesses. Simulating different levels of simplification—such as reducing the number of required documents, shortening response timelines, or providing clearer evaluation criteria—could help policymakers understand which adjustments would be most effective in promoting small business participation.

Financial Support or Administrative Burden Reduction
The impact of financial support (e.g., grants or low-interest loans) or the reduction of administrative burdens (e.g., streamlining documentation or evaluation processes) could be simulated to assess how such factors influence the likelihood of small businesses bidding on and winning contracts. This could also include simulations of different funding models or staggered payment schemes to help smaller businesses manage cash flow while fulfilling large contracts.

How Simulations Could Be Conducted
To run these simulations, historical procurement data could be used to build models of the procurement process. Factors like awarded amounts, contract categories, business size, and RFx types could be integrated into the simulation framework. The model could use Monte Carlo simulations, agent-based modeling, or other computational techniques to simulate a wide range of possible outcomes under varying conditions.

By adjusting key variables—such as the proportion of contracts set aside for small businesses or the simplification of bidding requirements—the simulation could generate different scenarios, predicting:

The overall increase in small business participation
Changes in the distribution of contract values
The potential economic benefits to small businesses
The impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement process
Benefits of Procurement Simulation Models
Data-Driven Policy Decisions: Simulations allow policymakers to test different approaches in a controlled, data-driven manner before committing to changes in the actual procurement process.

Cost-Effective: Running simulations can be far more cost-effective than implementing policy changes on a trial basis and allows for testing multiple scenarios simultaneously.

Identifying Optimal Interventions: By comparing the outcomes of different policy changes, simulations can identify the most effective strategies for promoting small business inclusion, allowing governments to make informed decisions based on projected outcomes.

Conclusion
Simulating procurement scenarios can complement existing data analysis by providing a forward-looking, predictive perspective. With the ability to model various "what-if" scenarios, such as introducing small business set-asides or simplifying bidding processes, simulations offer valuable insights into how policy changes can increase small business participation and equity in public procurement. By leveraging these predictive tools, policymakers can create more effective and inclusive procurement strategies that level the playing field for small businesses while ensuring efficient and fair contract allocation.

This analysis extends the insights from existing literature on public procurement, small business participation, and statistical modeling. Previous studies have identified several barriers that small businesses face in public procurement processes, including stringent qualification criteria and high financial thresholds that limit their access to high-value contracts.

For instance, research by Witt et al. [@Witt2019] explores how small businesses struggle to compete for government contracts, particularly when the bidding criteria favor larger firms with more resources. Their findings align with this study's conclusion that large businesses dominate high-value contracts, particularly in sectors like construction services and professional services [@Witt2019].

Moreover, Bolton et al. [@Bolton2004] highlight how public procurement policies, such as set-asides and subcontracting mandates, have been used to improve small business access to government contracts. These insights further reinforce the need for targeted reforms in procurement systems to facilitate greater participation from small firms. The UK's experience with supplier diversity initiatives is particularly relevant, as evidenced by Bolton et al. [@Bolton2004], who emphasized how diversity programs and government support have led to better outcomes for smaller suppliers.

The results of this study support these conclusions, highlighting that high-value contracts, particularly in specific categories, still present significant challenges for small businesses. There is also a strong case for implementing additional policy measures to ensure fairer representation in the procurement process.

By building on these findings, this paper underscores the importance of continuous policy interventions to mitigate the structural barriers small businesses face in public procurement.

can you edit the writing for me, An alternative model considered was Random Forest regression, which does not assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. However, logistic regression was chosen for its interpretability and the specific need to estimate odds ratios, which can provide meaningful insights for policy recommendations. Thus, there is some limitation of the model. The model assumes that the relationships between the predictors and the outcome are linear in the log-odds scale. If this assumption does not hold, the model may not fully capture the complexity of the data. The dataset is limited by its public nature, and variables such as supplier ownership or firm history are not included. These could provide additional insights into small business participation but are not available in the dataset.

An alternative model that was considered is Random Forest regression, which does not assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. However, logistic regression was ultimately chosen for its interpretability and its ability to estimate odds ratios, which are particularly valuable for deriving actionable insights and making policy recommendations. That said, there are some limitations to the model. Specifically, logistic regression assumes that the relationships between the predictors and the outcome are linear on the log-odds scale. If this assumption is not valid, the model may fail to capture the full complexity of the data. Additionally, the dataset is constrained by its public nature, and certain potentially important variables, such as supplier ownership or firm history, are not included. These factors could provide further insights into small business participation, but they are unavailable in the current dataset.
